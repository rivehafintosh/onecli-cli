// `onecli sandbox audit` — a one-command red-team of the enforce-mode
// sandbox.
//
// Enforce mode's whole promise is "egress cannot bypass the gateway".
// That promise is made of OS rules, and OS rules fail in ways that are
// invisible by inspection: a deny rule can be syntactically valid, load
// without error, and still never match. We shipped exactly that bug —
// `(path-literal "/var/run/docker.sock")` looked correct but never fired,
// because Seatbelt matches the RESOLVED path and Docker Desktop makes
// that path a symlink into ~/.docker/run. The profile "looked right" for
// as long as nobody tried the bypass.
//
// So the guarantee gets an executable test, runnable by anyone, on the
// machine that matters: this command runs each known escape technique
// inside the real profile and reports whether the OS actually stopped it.
//
// The probe table is the single source of truth: the live test
// (run_enforce_wrap_bypass_live_test.go) iterates the same table, so a
// vector added here is automatically covered in CI and by users.
