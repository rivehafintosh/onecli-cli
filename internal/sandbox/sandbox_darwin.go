// macOS backend: sandbox-exec with a generated Seatbelt profile that
// denies network-outbound except loopback. Seatbelt is inherited by the
// whole process tree and cannot be shed, so the only egress path is the
// loopback forwarder fronting the gateway.

import (

	"strings"
)

// seatbeltProfileTemplate is the Seatbelt profile for enforce-wrap mode.
// The forwarder port doesn't appear because ALL loopback is allowed.
//
// Design notes, validated empirically:
//   - Network governance only. Filesystem policy is deliberately absent:
//     WHICH hosts an agent may reach is the gateway's policy decision,
//     and file confinement is the agent's own sandbox's job (kept where
//     it can nest, disabled via the quirks table where it can't).
//   - Unix sockets stay allowed — they are local IPC (DNS via
//     mDNSResponder, ssh-agent), not egress. Except the Docker daemon:
//     a container runs OUTSIDE this sandbox, so docker.sock would be a
//     one-line egress bypass (`docker run --net=host curl ...`). The deny
//     is a REGEX on the socket name, not a path-literal on /var/run:
//     Seatbelt matches the RESOLVED path, and Docker Desktop ships
//     /var/run/docker.sock as a symlink into ~/.docker/run, so literal
//     rules for the well-known path silently never fire. Verified by
//     TestLiveEnforceWrapDockerSocketDenied — with path-literal rules the
//     daemon answered /version from inside the sandbox.
//   - All loopback is allowed, not just the forwarder port: local dev
//     servers must keep working, and loopback traffic cannot leave the
//     machine on its own.
//   - lsopen is denied: LaunchServices `open` launches the target app
//     OUTSIDE the sandbox, which would be a URL-fetch escape. Apple
//     Events are denied for the same reason (and further TCC-gated by
//     the OS).
//
// The filesystem rules exist FOR the network guarantee, which is why a
// "network-only" profile was never actually network-only in effect. A
// process that cannot dial out today can still write a file that an
// UNSANDBOXED process executes tomorrow — a LaunchAgent, a line in
// ~/.zshrc, a binary on $PATH — and that process has unrestricted egress.
// Deferred execution is a bypass with a delay, so the surfaces granting
// it are denied. Every one was reachable until these rules existed;
// `onecli sandbox audit` keeps them honest.
//
// This is deliberately NOT a cwd-only jail (the shape Claude Code's own
// sandbox uses). Agents legitimately write across $HOME — tool caches,
// language toolchains, session state — and a profile that breaks ordinary
// work gets switched off, which protects nobody. Denying the handful of
// launch-on-boot and run-on-next-shell surfaces closes the escape while
// leaving normal work untouched.
//
// {{HOME}} is materialized by profileFor: Seatbelt performs no
// $HOME expansion, so an unexpanded placeholder would load cleanly and
// match nothing — the same silent-no-op shape as the docker.sock bug.
//
// {{PORT}} is the loopback forwarder's port, and scoping the allow to it
// is load-bearing, not tidiness. Seatbelt's `(remote ip "localhost:*")`
// does NOT mean 127.0.0.1: it means any address local to this machine,
// which includes the host's LAN interfaces. With a wildcard port that let
// a sandboxed agent reach ANY listener bound to the host — a Docker
// container publishing a port, a dev server on 0.0.0.0 — and any such
// listener is unsandboxed, so it relays to the internet. Demonstrated
// end-to-end: with proxy env stripped, a secret was exfiltrated to a
// container via the host's LAN IP while direct egress was blocked.
//
// Seatbelt cannot express "127.0.0.1 but not the LAN" (it rejects any
// host other than * or localhost), so the port is the discriminator. The
// forwarder binds 127.0.0.1 on a random ephemeral port chosen per run, so
// an attacker cannot pre-position a listener there, and the LAN interface
// on that port has nothing listening.

; 'git init' and 'git clone' outright. A sandboxed agent can therefore
; still point a repo's hooks at a directory it controls, and that hook
; WILL execute unsandboxed on the next commit (confirmed experimentally,
; not assumed). The GLOBAL gitconfig is denied below because it is
; writable without breaking git and would apply to every repo at once.
; The per-repo path stays open, and closing it needs a mechanism this
; profile doesn't have — most likely inspecting core.hooksPath at commit
